                        I am a software developer with four years of experience. During one of my past jobs at a furniture company,
                        I had the opportunity to manage a team and work directly with clients. This experience taught me the
                        importance of client satisfaction and effective team management.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        In my current role at Mikronika, I coordinate directly with clients to understand and meet their expectations
                        while improving and maintaining the company's software solutions.

                        My approach to web design is rooted in the belief that there are no impossible tasks. With creativity,
                        persistence, and the right tools, any challenge can be overcome.
