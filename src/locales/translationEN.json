During one of my past jobs at a furniture company, I had the opportunity to manage a team of people and to work directly with the client. This is also where I learned firsthand how important it is to satisfy the client. I also enjoyed managing a team and would like to manage an IT team someday. In my current job at Mikronika, I directly coordinate with clients to understand and satisfy their expectations while improving and maintaining the company's software solutions.",
